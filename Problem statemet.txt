Problem Statement:


Problem Statement 1:
In the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, businesses struggle to effectively understand customer sentiments
 from a plethora of Amazon product reviews. This leads to missed opportunities for improving customer 
satisfaction and making data-driven decisions. The lack of a tailored sentiment analysis system for Amazon 
reviews hinders businesses from gaining insights into customer preferences, trends, and satisfaction levels,
 which are essential for maintaining a competitive edge.



Problem Statement 5:
Amazon sellers struggle to extract actionable insights from the vast amount of customer feedback available 
in product reviews. Traditional text-based analysis methods make it challenging to identify sentiment trends 
and correlations across different product categories effectively. The absence of a visualized sentiment 
analysis platform hinders sellers from gaining a comprehensive overview of customer perceptions,
 which is vital for making informed decisions about inventory, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.







====================================================
Design and develop a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews of Amazon products as either 
positive,negative, or neutral based on the text content of the reviews.

This is a dataset of Amazon E-Commerce that revolves around the reviews written by customers.
In this project, the Amazon tries to put themself in the E-Commerce owner's position where as the owner,
organiztion needs to understand and gain insight of the store sales, and one way to do that is by gaining 
it through customer's reviews. 

Aside from gaining insight, the author will also try to make a model to learn sentiments
from the review's data. The model could then predict review's sentiment, whether Positive, Neutral,
or Negative.

***********************************

E-Commerce portals are generating a lot of data every day in the form of customer reviews.
 Analyzing E-Commerce data will help online retailers to understand customer expectations, 
provide a better shopping experience, and to increase sales. Sentiment Analysis can be used to identify
 positive, negative, and neutral information from the customer reviews.

Topic flow
A well-defined problem statement is crucial for any data analysis or machine learning project. It serves as a guide for the entire project, helping you understand the objectives, scope, and expected outcomes. Here are the key components that should come in a problem statement:

1. **Objective:** Clearly state the goal of your analysis or project. What do you aim to achieve through this analysis? For example, are you trying to predict a certain outcome, understand trends, identify patterns, or make recommendations?

2. **Context:** Provide background information about the problem. Explain why this analysis is important and how it relates to a real-world situation or business challenge. What are the factors that have prompted this analysis?

3. **Scope:** Define the boundaries of your analysis. Specify the data sources you will use, the variables you will consider, and any limitations or constraints you might encounter. This helps to manage expectations and ensures that the project stays focused.

4. **Data Description:** Describe the dataset(s) you will be working with. This includes details about the structure of the data, the features (columns) it contains, and the size of the dataset. Mention any data preprocessing steps you've taken or need to take.

5. **Problem Statement:** Clearly articulate the specific question or problem you're aiming to solve. Use concise language to state what you want to accomplish with your analysis. This statement should be actionable and should guide the direction of your work.

6. **Metrics and Evaluation:** If applicable, specify how you will measure the success of your analysis. If you're building a model, mention the evaluation metrics you plan to use to assess its performance.

7. **Stakeholders and Audience:** Identify who will benefit from the results of your analysis or project. This could include business decision-makers, researchers, or any other relevant stakeholders. Understanding your audience helps tailor your approach and communication.

8. **Expected Deliverables:** Outline the expected outcomes of your project. This could be a report, a presentation, a model, or any other deliverable. Be specific about what you will provide to stakeholders.

9. **Timeline:** If applicable, provide an estimated timeline for the project. This helps set expectations regarding the duration of the analysis and when deliverables can be expected.

10. **Assumptions:** State any assumptions you're making about the data or the problem. This is important to clarify potential uncertainties.

Here's an example template incorporating these components:

**Problem Statement: Predicting Customer Churn for an E-commerce Platform**

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for XYZ E-commerce platform.

**Context:** The XYZ E-commerce platform has been experiencing a gradual increase in customer churn over the past few months. This churn rate is adversely affecting business revenues and long-term growth prospects. To mitigate this issue, the company aims to predict which customers are likely to churn and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Scope:** We will use historical customer data, including transaction history, demographics, and engagement metrics, to build and evaluate a predictive model. The analysis will focus on customers who have made at least one purchase in the last six months.

**Data Description:** The dataset comprises customer attributes, purchase history, engagement metrics, and churn labels. Missing values and outliers will be addressed during preprocessing.

**Problem Statement:** Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn based on historical data. The model should provide insights into the key factors driving churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain high-value customers.

**Metrics and Evaluation:** The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine the potential impact of implementing retention strategies based on model predictions.

**Stakeholders and Audience:** The findings of this analysis will be presented to the executive team, including the CEO and VP of Marketing, who are responsible for making strategic decisions to improve customer retention.

**Expected Deliverables:** A comprehensive report detailing the data exploration process, preprocessing steps, model selection and training, evaluation metrics, key insights, and recommendations for targeted retention strategies. A presentation summarizing the findings will also be prepared for the stakeholders.

**Timeline:** The project is expected to be completed within eight weeks, including data collection, analysis, modeling, and reporting.

**Assumptions:** We assume that the provided historical data is representative of the current customer behavior and that external factors such as market trends and economic conditions will remain relatively stable during the analysis period.
